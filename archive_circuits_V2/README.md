## Temporary archive of Circuits V2

Original circuits which are in production are in `circuits` directory.

Refactored ones are in `circuits_after_refactoring`.

Tests use `circuits` directory, so to run tests on refactored ones you need 
to rename `circuits` to something else, and then `circuits_after_refactoring` 
to `circuits`.
